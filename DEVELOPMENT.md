# Development/Releasing of this Project

## Development

You can use CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.

**Reminder:** Please see the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/google/gtm-session-fetcher/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file for how to contribute to this project.

## Swift Package Manager

*  `open Package.swift` or double click `Package.swift` in Finder.
*  Xcode will open the project
   *  The _GTMSessionFetcher-Package_ scheme seems generally the simplest to
      build everything and run tests.
   *  Choose a target platform by selecting the run destination along with the
      scheme

## CocoaPods

Install
*  CocoaPods 1.10.0 (or later)
*  [CocoaPods generate](https://github.com/square/cocoapods-generate) - This is
    not part of the _core_ cocoapods install.

Generate an Xcode project from the podspec:

```
pod gen GTMSessionFetcher.podspec --local-sources=./ --auto-open --platforms=ios
```

Note: Set the `--platforms` option to `macos`, `tvos`, or `watchos` to
develop/test for those platforms.

## Releasing

To update the version number and push a release:

1.  Examine what has changed; determine the appropriate new version number.

1.  Update the version number.

    Run the `update_version.py` script to update the appropriate files with the
    new version number, by passing in the new version (must be in X.Y.Z format).

    ```sh
    ./update_version.py 1.3.1
    ```

    Submit the changes to the repo.

1.  Create a release on Github.

    Top left of the [project's release page](https://github.com/google/gtm-session-fetcher/releases)
    is _Draft a new release_.

    The tag should be vX.Y.Z where the version number X.Y.Z _exactly_ matches
    the one you provided to the `update_version.py` script. (GTMSessionFetcher
    has a `v` prefix on its tags.)

    For the description call out any major changes in the release. Usually the
    _Generate release notes_ button in the toolbar is a good starting point and
    just updating as need for more/less detail (dropping comments about CI,
    updating the version number, etc.).

1.  Publish the CocoaPod.

    ```sh
    pod trunk push --skip-tests GTMSessionFetcher.podspec
    ```

    NOTE: We use `--skip-tests` because CocoaPods has issues testing spec that
    have tests and target watchOS. The CI setup also skips the tests for watchOS
    for the same reason. Since we generally get testing on ever PR these seems
    to be safe. If CI ever can start to enable watchOS tests, that running the
    tests against as part of the push will be an option.
